# MacroFitCalc - Final Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Email Collection
**Why:** You asked "Why do we ask for email address?"

Email collection was removed because:
- It's unnecessary for a free calculator
- Creates friction in the user experience
- Requires backend infrastructure to actually send emails
- Was never functional (just a placeholder)

**What changed:**
- Removed Step 5 (email input)
- Removed email validation
- Calculator now has 4 steps instead of 5
- Final step (Step 4) now directly calculates macros

### 2. ✅ Added "Start Over" Button
**Why:** You asked for a home button to go back to the first page

**What it does:**
- Appears at the top of the results page
- Resets the calculator to Step 1
- Clears the form state
- Allows users to calculate for someone else or recalculate

**How it works:**
```javascript
function goHome() {
    document.querySelector('.calc-card').style.display = 'block';
    document.querySelector('.results').classList.remove('active');
    currentStep = 1;
    // Resets step indicators and scrolls to top
}
```

## Current User Flow

### Old Flow (5 steps):
1. Stats (age, weight, height)
2. Sex
3. Activity level
4. Goal
5. Email ← **REMOVED**
6. Results

### New Flow (4 steps):
1. Stats (age, weight, height)
2. Sex
3. Activity level  
4. Goal → **Calculate directly**
5. Results (with Start Over button)

## Why This Is Better

✅ **Faster:** One less step
✅ **Simpler:** No email required
✅ **More honest:** No fake "we'll email you" promise
✅ **Better UX:** Clear "Start Over" button to recalculate
✅ **Privacy-focused:** Explicitly states "All calculations are done locally"

## Technical Notes

- Step progression: `currentStep < 4` (was 5)
- Step dots: 4 dots instead of 5
- Validation: Removed email regex check
- Navigation: Step 4 button calls `doCalculate()` directly
- Results: Added home button at top
